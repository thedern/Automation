# Automation
# The files in this directory are purposed for the automation of cve deploys
# All scripts are called via the master script, cveWrapperMenu.py
# When reviewing the scripts it would be helpful to use cveWrapperMenu.py as the starting point
# Scripts have been tested individually up to 7/27/2018.  The final round of testing from the master script has yet to be conducted.
